# Patterns
Patterns can be divided in three categories:
* Structural
* Creational
* Behavioural

##  Structural Patterns
### Decorator
* Lets you attach a new behaviour to objects by placing them inside a wrapper object that contain the behaviour.
* In the example we have different types of notification. The only difference between the types is the behavior associated
with act of sending the notification.
