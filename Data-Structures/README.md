# Data structure

## Linked List
* linear data structure where elements are linked using pointers
* each element (node) contains the data and a pointer to the next element in the linked list.
* Because each node has pointer to the next element they don't need to be stored next to each other, which 
make addition and deletion less expensive.
* Single linked list: node have pointers to next node
* Doubly linked list: node have points to next and previous node

* Disadvantages:
    * More memory required (data + pointers for each node)
    * search is still time consuming (need to iterate all list and look for next pointer)
    
## Queue
* First in First out -  **FIFO**, first person in the line is first person out of the line
* elements are inserted at the end and removed from the beginning 


## Stack
* order list 
* **LIFO** - last in first first out

## Hash map
* used key-value pairs
