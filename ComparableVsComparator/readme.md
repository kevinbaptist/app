#Simple project show the difference between Comparable and Comparator in Java


## Comparable object
* Capable of comparing itself with another object
* it has disadvantage that we can only have one way of comparing

##  Comparator 
* Is an external class, therefore we can have as many comparators for a specific class as we want
* it can be used with streams
